# Getting Started

First of all, thank you for taking an interest in the Lume compiler! The Lume programming language is still
very new, so a lot of things have yet to be fleshed out completely. That is to say, if you notice some issues
or errors, please let us know!

## Asking Questions

Even though the compiler is relatively new, it can still be very complicated - we won't judge for not
understanding it immediately. We currently don't have any outside infrastructure to support a forum-like
page, so we currently use [Github] for most back-and-forth between developers
and end-users.

**If you have found an issue or error within the compiler,** feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker]. This can be anything from typos and smaller changes to larger issues within the compiler. Since the project is as young as it is, it is likely that you'll find a handful of bugs.

**If you have a question about Lume or the compiler,** you can create a new post under the [discussion board]. If you want to learn anything about the language or compiler which you can't
find in this book, you can create a post on there. Try to see if anyone has posted a similar question, which may answer
you question.

**If you want to contribute to the compiler,** there's many different ways to do so! Depending on your specific skills,
you can make a huge difference for other people trying out the Lume compiler. The following tasks can be done without
much background knowledge, but are invaluable for the project:
- Writing documentation, both for this book or within the code itself. A lot of code within the compiler is
  undocumented, which can make it harder for others to understand. By doing this, you'll likely also learn a lot
  from the compiler.
- Answering questions on the issue tracker, as well as participating in discussions about the project. It's important
  to voice your opinion about the project, since it helps shape it's next iterations.

## Chapters

1. [Building and debugging the compiler](building-the-compiler) is useful for all contributors to the Lume
   compiler, as it explains how to interact with the codebase.
